## Getting Started

Claude Code is an interactive CLI tool that helps with software engineering tasks. It can read files, write code, run commands, search codebases, and much more.

### Installation
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code
# or use pnpm/yarn
pnpm add -g @anthropic/claude-code
```

### First Run
```bash
claude-code
# You'll be prompted to enter your API key on first use
```

## Hello World Examples

### 1. Basic Hello World
**You:** Create a Python hello world script

Claude will create `hello.py`:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### 2. Interactive Hello World
**You:** Create an interactive hello world that asks for the user's name

Claude will create `interactive_hello.py`:
```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Claude Code.")
```

### 3. Web Server Hello World
**You:** Create a simple web server that responds with hello world

Claude will create a Node.js server or Python Flask app based on your environment.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. File Operations
- **Read files**: Claude can read any file in your project
- **Write/Edit files**: Create new files or modify existing ones
- **Search**: Find patterns across your entire codebase

### 2. Code Understanding
- Analyzes code structure and dependencies
- Understands multiple programming languages
- Follows existing code conventions

### 3. Task Management
- Built-in todo list for complex tasks
- Tracks progress through multi-step operations
- Helps break down large features

### 4. Command Execution
- Run build commands
- Execute tests
- Install dependencies
- Git operations

### 5. Web Research
- Search for documentation
- Find solutions to errors
- Research best practices

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
```
❌ "Fix the bug"
✅ "Fix the TypeError in src/utils.py line 42 when parsing JSON"
```

### 2. Use Context Files
Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root with:
- Project overview
- Coding conventions
- Common commands
- Architecture notes

### 3. Leverage Todo Lists
For complex tasks, Claude automatically creates todo lists:
```
You: Refactor the authentication system to use JWT tokens

Claude will:
1. Create a todo list
2. Analyze current auth implementation
3. Plan the refactoring steps
4. Execute each step
5. Run tests to verify
```

### 4. Review Changes
Always review Claude's changes before committing:
```bash
git diff  # Claude can run this for you
```

### 5. Iterative Development
Work in small, focused iterations:
```
You: Add user registration endpoint
[Claude implements]
You: Now add email validation
[Claude adds validation]
You: Add rate limiting to prevent spam
[Claude adds rate limiting]
```

## Extensibility & Sharing

### Personal vs Shared Configurations

#### Personal Preferences (~/.claude/)
Keep these private to your machine:
```
~/.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md          # Your personal coding preferences
├── settings.json      # API keys, personal settings
└── mcp_settings.json  # Personal MCP server configs
```

Example personal CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
- Always use 2 spaces for indentation
- Prefer async/await over promises
- Add detailed commit messages
- Run tests before marking tasks complete
```

#### Shared Team Configuration (project root)
Share these with your team:
```
project/
├── CLAUDE.md          # Project-specific instructions
├── .claude/           # Team settings
│   └── mcp_servers/   # Shared MCP tools
└── README.md          # Include Claude Code setup
```

Example team CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
## Project Standards
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use TypeScript for all new features
- API endpoints must have OpenAPI docs
- All PRs require passing tests

## Common Commands
- `npm test` - Run test suite
- `npm run lint` - Check code style
- `make deploy` - Deploy to staging
```

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers

Extend Claude Code with custom tools:

#### Example: Database Query Tool
```json
// .claude/mcp_settings.json
{
  "servers": {
    "database": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["tools/db_mcp_server.py"],
      "description": "Query project database"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example: Company API Tool
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "internal-api": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["tools/api-client.js"],
      "description": "Interact with internal APIs"
    }
  }
}
```

### Sharing Capabilities

1. **Documentation Templates**
   ```bash
   # Share a template for new team members
   cp ~/.claude/templates/CLAUDE.md.template new-project/CLAUDE.md
   ```

2. **MCP Server Library**
   ```bash
   # Create a team repository of MCP tools
   git clone company/claude-code-tools
   cp claude-code-tools/servers/* .claude/mcp_servers/
   ```

3. **Best Practices Wiki**
   Create a team wiki with:
   - Successful prompts
   - Common patterns
   - Troubleshooting guides

## Tips for AI-Hesitant Teams

### 1. Start Small
Begin with low-risk, high-value tasks:
- Writing unit tests
- Adding documentation
- Fixing linting errors
- Creating boilerplate code

### 2. Demonstrate Time Savings
**Example: Adding Tests**
```
Traditional: 2 hours to write comprehensive tests
With Claude: 15 minutes + review time

You: Add unit tests for the UserService class with edge cases
[Claude analyzes the class and creates thorough tests]
```

### 3. Show Code Quality
Claude follows YOUR team's patterns:
```
You: Look at our existing API endpoints and create a new one for user profiles
[Claude matches your exact patterns, naming conventions, and structure]
```

### 4. Emphasize Claude as a Pair Programmer
- It doesn't replace developers
- It handles tedious tasks
- Developers focus on design and review
- All code is reviewed before commit

### 5. Build Confidence Gradually
Week 1: Documentation and tests
Week 2: Bug fixes and refactoring  
Week 3: New feature development
Week 4: Architecture discussions

### 6. Real-World Success Stories

**Refactoring Example:**
```
You: We need to split our monolithic user.py file into separate modules

Claude will:
1. Analyze dependencies
2. Propose a structure
3. Create new files
4. Update imports
5. Ensure tests still pass
```

**Debugging Example:**
```
You: Getting "ConnectionRefused" error when running tests

Claude will:
1. Read the error logs
2. Check configuration files
3. Identify the root cause
4. Propose and implement a fix
5. Verify the fix works
```

### 7. Address Common Concerns

**"Will it write bad code?"**
- Claude follows YOUR codebase patterns
- You review all changes
- It learns from your corrections

**"Is it secure?"**
- Runs locally on your machine
- Doesn't store your code
- You control what it accesses

**"Will it replace developers?"**
- It's a tool, like an IDE
- Developers make decisions
- AI handles implementation

## Advanced Features

### 1. Multi-File Operations
```
You: Rename all instances of 'getUserData' to 'fetchUserProfile' across the codebase
```

### 2. Architecture Planning
```
You: Help me design a caching layer for our API
```

### 3. Code Reviews
```
You: Review this PR and suggest improvements: [paste PR link]
```

### 4. Learning New Technologies
```
You: Show me how to add GraphQL to our Express server
```

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to show value:
1. Time saved on repetitive tasks
2. Reduced bugs (from better tests)
3. Improved documentation coverage
4. Faster onboarding of new developers
5. Consistent code style
